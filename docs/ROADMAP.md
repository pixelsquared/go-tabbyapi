# Go TabbyAPI Client: Project Summary and Roadmap

This document provides an overview of the current state and future direction of the Go TabbyAPI client library. It serves as a guide for both users and contributors to understand the library's capabilities, quality standards, and planned development.

## 1. Project Summary

### Overview of Completed Work

The Go TabbyAPI client library has been successfully developed as a comprehensive Go interface to [TabbyAPI](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby), an open-source self-hosted AI coding assistant. The library follows idiomatic Go patterns and provides a clean, well-documented API for interacting with TabbyAPI services.

The client library has been designed with:
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Intuitive interfaces for each feature area
- Comprehensive error handling
- Configurable options for authentication, timeouts, and retries
- Detailed documentation and usage examples

### Key Features Implemented

The library provides full coverage of TabbyAPI's functionality:

- **Text Completions**: Generate text based on prompts with support for both synchronous and streaming responses
- **Chat Completions**: Handle multi-turn conversations with different message roles (system, user, assistant)
- **Embeddings**: Generate vector representations of text inputs
- **Model Management**: List, load, unload, and query information about models
- **LoRA Adapters**: Manage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for fine-tuning models
- **Prompt Templates**: List, switch, and unload prompt templates for different model architectures
- **Token Operations**: Encode text to tokens and decode tokens to text
- **Sampling Parameters**: Configure and manage text generation parameters
- **Health Checks**: Verify the status of the TabbyAPI server
- **Authentication**: Support multiple authentication methods and permission levels

### Architecture Overview

The library is built around a central `Client` interface that provides access to various service-specific interfaces:

```
Client
  ├── CompletionsService
  ├── ChatService
  ├── EmbeddingsService
  ├── ModelsService
  ├── LoraService
  ├── TemplatesService
  ├── TokensService
  ├── SamplingService
  ├── HealthService
  └── AuthService
```

This architecture allows for:
- Modular and focused service implementations
- Clear responsibilities for each component
- Easy extension with new features
- Simplified testing and maintenance

The internal implementation uses a layered approach:
1. High-level service interfaces (`tabby` package)
2. Mid-level REST client handling (`internal/rest` package)
3. Low-level authentication and network operations (`internal/auth`, etc.)

### Library Capabilities and API Coverage

The library provides 100% coverage of the TabbyAPI specification, including:

- **Authentication Methods**:
  - API Key authentication for standard operations
  - Admin Key authentication for administrative operations
  - Bearer Token authentication for OAuth/JWT integration

- **Request Customization**:
  - Configurable timeouts and retries
  - Custom HTTP client support
  - Streaming response handling

- **Error Handling**:
  - Structured error types for different error scenarios
  - Detailed error messages and context
  - Retry support for transient errors

- **Data Management**:
  - Type-safe request and response structures
  - Proper handling of different data formats
  - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations

## 2. Testing and Quality Summary

### Overview of Test Coverage

The library includes comprehensive test coverage across its components:

- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between components
- **API Tests**: Validate the correctness of API interactions
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensure proper handling of error conditions

Test files are located alongside the code they test, following Go conventions:
- `internal/auth/auth_test.go`
- `internal/rest/client_test.go`
- `internal/stream/stream_test.go`

### Benchmark Results

Performance benchmarks have been implemented for critical components:

- **REST Client Benchmarks** (`internal/rest/client_benchmark_test.go`):
  - Measure request/response processing performance
  - Evaluate serialization/deserialization overhead
  - Test different payload sizes and request types

- **Streaming Benchmarks** (`internal/stream/stream_benchmark_test.go`):
  - Measure streaming performance with different loads
  - Evaluate memory usage during streaming operations
  - Test connection handling and error recovery

These benchmarks help ensure that the library maintains good performance characteristics and can identify performance regressions during development.

### Code Quality Metrics

The library adheres to high code quality standards:

- **Static Analysis**: Code is regularly checked with `golangci-lint` to catch potential issues
- **Documentation**: All exported functions, types, and constants are documented with godoc comments
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources like HTTP connections and file handles
- **API Design**: Consistent and intuitive API design following Go best practices
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies to reduce vulnerability surface
